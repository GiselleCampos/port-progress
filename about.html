    <h2>Can I <i>not</i> talk about myself?</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Chula Vista, California, I've always been surrounded by the arts in one form or an other. I knew when I was young I knew that I wanted to work as an artist and designer, and now I'm making that happen!</p>

        <p>I started my art career in high school, but I've been drawing awkward characters with their hands behind their backs and one eye covered by their hair since I can remember. We were all in that stage once, and I chose to move on forward from it and make it my career. Now I draw people at a 3/4 angle so I don't have to worry about symmetry!</p>
    
        <p>Since starting my college education, I feel that I've learned a good amount, and am still learning more everyday! I'm hoping to start interning in the design world soon, prefferably for textile or packagng related products and companies.</p>
